# Text-Classification
A Text-Classification Model trained on the IMDB Movie reviews, the intention behind development of the model is to predict the upcoming/new reviews to categorize them as positive or negative review. This model will further be modified such that it can suggest the users movies based on their reviews, for say the machine can understand the users interest in movie jouners and will suggest them movies based on their likeliness.

This model has achieved an accuracy level of "0.86" which is after being trained on a dataset of 5000 inputs.
